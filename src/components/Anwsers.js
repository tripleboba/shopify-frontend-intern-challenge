            <strong>If I were to open a Shopify store</strong>, I would open a service specializing in renting out random things in the area for short periods.
            <br></br>The idea came from once when I went to a milk tea shop and left my glasses at home while I was more than halfway to the store.
            While I had a hard time reading the tiny menu of the milk tea shop hanging in the back, next to me was a couple making an order.
            The boyfriend read each item on the menu to his girlfriend for her since she couldn't see those mini words too.
            At that moment, I thought why would noone make an app that could rent a person in the area with a 10/10 eyesight or the binoculars to read the menu and get pay for those 2-3 minutes.
            If running a business was easy, I would create an online store offering that service.

            <strong>Last thoughts?</strong> Yes. I just realized that my idea of opening this type of service is pretty bad because users need a phone to book a service. And smartphones all have the zoom in feature which people can use to read the menu. This is probably the reason why no one has opened this service.
